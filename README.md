## Objective

notStarbucks is an application that utilizes Firebase authentication with google, along with a platform for finding coffee shops that are not Starbucks. The application works by utilizing Google API's (Maps, Places, Geolocation) to find these shops and display them on the page.

notStarbucks achieves this by using modals to enter either any zip code in the world, or selecting an option to geolocate the user automatically and display the results on the page. The API querys for the 20 closest shops with keywords "cafe and coffee" and displays their address, price rating, and name in cards on the page.
